# HER Variations

My goal is to explore combinations of HER with other RL algorithms. 

## Combinations

* Deep Q-Learning with HER
* Cross Entropy with HER
* Policy Gradients with HER 
* Proximal Policy Optimization with HER

## Possible research directions

* [Improving Stochastic Policy Gradients in Continuous Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning using the Beta Distribution](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/chou17a/chou17a.pdf)
* [Multiagent Cooperation and Competition with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.08779.pdf)
* [Benchmarking Deep Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06778)
