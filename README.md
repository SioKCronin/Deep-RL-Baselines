# HER Variations

OpenAI's Mar 2018 request for research highlighted the research trajectory of combining HER with other advances in RL. The goal of HER Variations is to explore these possibilities. 

## Combinations

* Deep Q-Learning with HER
* Cross Entropy with HER
* Policy Gradients with HER 
* Proximal Policy Optimization with HER
